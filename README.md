## About

Spectrum Security is a small project written entirely in Python.
To check a PC for viruses, it uses specially trained machine learning, which recognizes malicious code in Windows executable files with up to 90% accuracy.

Antivirus can work in three modes:
• Full verification
• Checking the folder
• File verification

In the future, the project will be updated, getting better and better.
